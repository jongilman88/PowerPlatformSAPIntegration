# Power Platform SAP Integration
Here you will find a number of solutions that will enable your organization to integrate Microsoft's Power Platform with SAP.

# Pre-Requisites
Before you get started with these solutions, you will need to prepare your Power Platform environment for SAP integration. This can take anywhere from 4 hours for a seasoned Power Platform architect to a few days for a novice.

## Install Data Gateway
You have 2 options for installing the gateway and configuring your environment:
1. Closely read and follow [Microsoft's written documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/enterprise-templates/finance/sap-procurement/administer/requirements).
2. Use [Microsoft's SAP Setup Assistant](https://github.com/microsoft/Templates-for-Power-Platform/tree/main/Solution%20Packages%20For%20Manual%20Install/SAP%20Setup%20Assistant) to guide you through the process.

## Import SAP Base Solution
Next you need to import [Microsoft's SAP Base solution](https://github.com/microsoft/Templates-for-Power-Platform/tree/main/Solution%20Packages%20For%20Manual%20Install/Finance/Finance%20Base%20Pack) into your enviroment. If you chose option 2 above and already installed the SAP base solution, then skip this step.

# Solutions
Once you've performed the pre-requisites, you're now ready to start importing solutions for your respective business processes.

You have 2 options for installing the gateway and configuring your environment:
1. Closely read and follow [Microsoft's written documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/enterprise-templates/finance/sap-procurement/administer/requirements).
2. Use [Microsoft's SAP Setup Assistant](https://github.com/microsoft/Templates-for-Power-Platform/tree/main/Solution%20Packages%20For%20Manual%20Install/SAP%20Setup%20Assistant) to guide you through the process.
